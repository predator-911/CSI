"""## Introduction to git and version control

### Subtask:
Briefly explain the concepts of version control and Git.

**Reasoning**:
I need to explain version control and Git concisely as instructed. I will use a markdown cell for this explanation.
"""

# Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
# It's essential in software development and data science because it allows teams to collaborate effectively, track changes, revert to previous states if needed, and manage different versions of code or data.
# Without version control, managing changes, especially in collaborative projects, becomes chaotic, making it hard to identify who made what changes, when, and why, and making it difficult to fix errors or revert unwanted modifications.

# Git is a widely-used, open-source distributed version control system (DVCS).
# Unlike centralized systems where there's a single repository, Git allows every developer to have a full copy of the repository on their local machine.
# This distributed nature means that operations like committing and viewing history are fast because they are performed locally.
# It also provides resilience, as the failure of a central server doesn't prevent developers from continuing to work.
# Git is used to manage the history of projects, allowing users to track changes, branch for parallel development, merge changes, and collaborate with others.

"""**Reasoning**:
The explanations for version control and Git have been provided in the previous code block as comments. I will now format these explanations into a clear markdown cell to fulfill the instructions.

### Version Control and Git Explained

**Version Control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It's crucial in software development and data science because it enables teams to collaborate efficiently, track who made what changes and when, revert to previous working states, and manage different iterations of code or data without overwriting each other's work. Without it, projects quickly become unmanageable, making debugging and collaboration extremely difficult.

**Git** is a popular **distributed version control system (DVCS)**. The key word here is 'distributed'. Unlike older, centralized systems where everyone works off a single central server, Git allows each developer to have a complete copy of the project's history and files on their local machine. This makes common operations like committing changes or viewing history very fast. It also means you can work offline and that there's no single point of failure. Git provides the tools to track changes, create separate lines of development (branching), combine changes from different lines (merging), and work together on projects.

### Creating a Repository on GitHub and Linking Local Repository

To create a new repository on GitHub:

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com).
2.  Log in to your account.
3.  In the upper-right corner, click the '+' icon and select "New repository".
4.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-git-project`).
5.  You can add an optional description.
6.  Choose whether the repository should be Public or Private.
7.  You can optionally initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license. For linking a local repository, it's often simpler to leave these unchecked initially.
8.  Click the "Create repository" button.

After creating the repository on GitHub, you will be shown a page with instructions. Look for the section "or push an existing repository from the command line". It will provide commands to link your local repository.

To link your existing local Git repository to the newly created remote repository on GitHub, you will use the following command in your local terminal (or in this notebook's terminal if you were working locally):

```bash
git remote add origin <https://github.com/predator-911/CSI>
```

Replace `<remote_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this URL on your GitHub repository page (look for the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL).

The `git remote add origin` command does two things:
*   `git remote add`: This command adds a new remote connection to your local repository.
*   `origin`: This is the conventional name given to the primary remote repository. While you could name it something else, `origin` is the standard and is widely understood. It essentially acts as a shortcut for the remote repository's URL.
*   `<remote_repository_url>`: This is the address of the repository on GitHub.

Once this command is executed, your local repository knows about the remote repository on GitHub and can interact with it (e.g., push and pull changes).

"""## Push local changes to github

### Subtask:
Use `git push` to upload committed changes to the remote repository.

**Reasoning**:
Execute the `git push` command to upload the local commits to the remote repository. If it's the first push, the output will likely suggest setting the upstream branch, which is the next step if needed.
"""

!git push origin main

"""**Reasoning**:
The previous `git push` command failed because the local branch `main` does not exist or the remote `origin` is not correctly set up. Based on the error message "src refspec main does not match any", it indicates that the local branch named `main` does not exist. I need to check the local branch name first.


"""

!git branch

"""**Reasoning**:
The output of `git branch` shows that the local branch is named `master`, not `main`. I need to push the `master` branch instead of `main`.

### Subtask:
Practice creating new branches, switching between them, committing changes on different branches, and pushing branches to GitHub.

**Reasoning**:
The previous attempts to push to a remote repository failed because the remote 'origin' was not configured. Before proceeding with branching, it is essential to have a working remote connection to GitHub to push the new branch later. Therefore, I need to set up the remote 'origin' correctly. I will use the `git remote add origin` command. Since I don't have the actual remote repository URL, I will use a placeholder and indicate that the user needs to replace it.

### Pull Requests on GitHub

While merging branches locally using `git merge` is common, in collaborative environments on platforms like GitHub, a **Pull Request (PR)** (sometimes also called a Merge Request on other platforms like GitLab) is the standard way to propose and merge changes.

A Pull Request is essentially a request to merge one branch into another (e.g., merging your `feature/new-feature` branch into `master`). It's more than just a merge instruction; it's a **discussion and code review mechanism**.

Here's how it generally works:

1.  You create a new branch (`feature/new-feature`).
2.  You make your changes and commit them to this branch.
3.  You push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
4.  On GitHub, you open a Pull Request from your `feature/new-feature` branch targeting the `master` (or main) branch.
5.  The PR serves as a forum for:
    *   Describing the changes you made.
    *   Showing the exact differences (diff) between the branches.
    *   Allowing other team members to review your code, leave comments, and suggest improvements.
    *   Running automated checks (like tests or linters) if configured.
6.  Once the code is reviewed and approved, and any necessary changes are made, the PR can be **merged** on GitHub. GitHub performs the merge operation on the server.

**Why use Pull Requests?**

*   **Code Review:** Ensures code quality and allows for feedback before integrating changes.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitates discussion among team members about proposed changes.
*   **Tracking:** Provides a clear history of proposed changes, reviews, and merges.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Can trigger automated builds, tests, and deployments.

In summary, while `git merge` is the underlying command, a Pull Request on GitHub adds a crucial layer of review, discussion, and automation, making it the preferred method for merging in team projects.
